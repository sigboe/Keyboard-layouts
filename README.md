# Keyboard-layouts
This repository is just for me to keep my layouts for my [Input.club](https://input.club) keyboards.

## How to use these layouts.

Go to [Input.club](https://input.club) and open up the configurator. Click import map, then paste the contents of the json files. To flash a keyboard with the layout check out the guide for how to use dfu-util for win/mac/lin [here](https://input.club/configurator-setup) 

## License and credits

I need to give credits to Alexander from input.club for designing the keyboards, and the json structure. The layout variations I make are public domain.
